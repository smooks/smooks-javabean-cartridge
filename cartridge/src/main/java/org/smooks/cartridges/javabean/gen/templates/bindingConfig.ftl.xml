    <!-- TODO:
            THIS IS A CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE!!  It is not the finished article.

            1. For each <jb:bindings> element, set the createOnElement attribute to the event element that should
               be used to create the bean instance.
            2. Update the <jb:value data> attributes to select the event element/attribute supplying the binding
               data for that bean property.
            3. Check the <jb:value decoder> attributes.  Not all will be set, depending on the actual property type.
               These must be configured by hand e.g. you may need to configure <jb:decodeParam>
               sub-elements for the decoder on some of the bindings.  E.g. for a date field:
                    <jb:value property="date" data="header/date" decoder="Date">
                        <jb:decodeParam name="format">EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy</jb:decodeParam>
                    </jb:value>
            4. Double-check the binding config elements (<jb:value> and <jb:wiring>), making sure all Java properties
               have been covered in the generated configuration.

            Determining appropriate values for the <jb:bean createOnElement> and <jb:value data> attributes can
            sometimes be difficult, especially for non XML Sources (Java etc).  The Html Reporting tool can be a great
            help here because it helps you visualise the input message model (against which the selectors will be
            applied) as seen by Smooks.  So, first off, generate a report using your Source data, but with an empty
            transformation configuration.  In the report, you can see the model against which you need to add your
            configurations.  Add the configurations one at a time, rerunning the report to check they are being applied.

            For details on how to run a report, see the Smooks User Guide (http://milyn.codehaus.org/Smooks+User+Guide#SmooksUserGuide-CheckingtheSmooksExecutionProcess).
